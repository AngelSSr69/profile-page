        <p class="p">
            My name is Angel Salazar, I'm 19 years old, and I lived in Mississippi my whole life. I went and graduated from Vardaman High School, with honors. 
            I'm currently a student at Base Camp Coding Academy, where I’m learning how to do frontend and backend coding and be a full stack developer. 
            I’m hoping in the future to get more into video game development and start creating my own video games. 
            My reason for going into video game development is because I was inspired by FromSoftwear games. 
            I’m still new to coding but I’m still trying my best to learn and understand.
